We know that according to Pythagoras' theorem, if we have two sides of a right-angled triangle, calculate the value of the third side using the equation below.
```
c = sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
```
Naming the sides of a right triangle in the program is like the picture above.

### notes
1.Please design this program in different languages and put it in this repository. Please put your code in ```src``` folder  and then in a folder named that language.

### How To Use :

## PHP :
> 1: clone project and run it
> <br/>
> 2: request to www.{url}.com/src/PHP/a={number of a}&b={number of b}
> <br/>
> 3: then if your request is fine you will get this response :
> <br/>
> {
> <br/>
> "code" : 200,
> <br/>
> "message" : "Done!",
> <br/>
> 'sum^2' => c^2,
> <br/>
> 'sum' => c
> <br/>
> }
<br/>
